The program simulates memory allocation with a chosen hole-fitting algorithm (First-fit, Best-fit, Worst-fit) and implements deallocation and defragmentation of memory blocks.
A menu controls the operations, and each choice calls the appropriate procedure, where the choices are:
1) Enter parameters
2) Allocate memory for a block using First-Fit
3) Allocate memory for a block using Best-Fit
4) Allocate memory for a block using Worst-fit
5) Deallocate memory for a block
6) Defragment memory
7) Quit the program and free memory
